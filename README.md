- 👋 Hi, I’m @uv0id2, a somewhat *random and lazy* programmer ! Nevertheless i'm looking forward to work and learn with you<br />
I lost access to my <a href="https://github.com/uv0id">old account</a> so i've created this one
- 👀 I’m interested in ***creating cool stuffs with code***
- 🌱 I’ve been learning *Rust* and *C* for quite a while now, though i also have experience with other more, traditional languanges like *Java*. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything that catches my *attention*, and challenges that i'm confident i can take on
