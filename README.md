- 👋 Hi, I’m @refcounter, a somewhat *perfection* striving developer (yeah, platonic i know) ! Nevertheless i'm looking forward to work and learn with you<br />
I lost access to my <a href="https://github.com/uv0id">old account</a> so i've created this one
- 👀 I’m interested in ***creating cool stuffs with code***
- 🌱 I’ve been learning *Rust*, *C* and *go* for quite a while now, though i got to keep my employability through more traditional languanges like *Java, C#, JavaScript, and Python*. Also, i recent days i got quite a liking to *Lua*.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything that catches my *attention*.
