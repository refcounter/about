👋 Hey there, I’m @refcounter, an avid developer on a quest for coding excellence (although I'll admit, it's more of a platonic pursuit)! Collaborating, learning, and crafting are my jam, and I'm excited to embark on this journey with you.

Lost access to my [previous account](https://github.com/uv0id), but hey, fresh starts are invigorating!

- 👀 I’m all about **weaving magic with code** to create awesome things
- 🌱 I’ve been immersed in the world of *Rust*, *C*, and *Go* for quite some time. Meanwhile, I'm seamlessly navigating through more traditional languages like *Java*, *C#*, *JavaScript*, and *Python*. Oh, and lately, I've caught a wave of fascination for *Lua*.
- 💞️ If a project catches my *curiosity*, I'm all in for some amazing collaboration.

Check out the snapshot of languages across my repos:
